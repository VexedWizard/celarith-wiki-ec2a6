A half orc who is a zealous as they come, but understands that a pastoral figure is required to get the Ashen Hand in order. As much a father figure as Penn has ever had, he's wise and kind, but offers tough life lessons. He reports directly to [[Nyrrheim/Father Rhaegor Nox- High Inquisitor of the Ashen Hand\|Father Rhaegor Nox- High Inquisitor of the Ashen Hand]], who tolerates his approaches, but is often vociferously opposed to what he calls 'the weakness of kindness' that Benedictus Rowan breeds within the rank.
