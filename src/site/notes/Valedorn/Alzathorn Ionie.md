Apprentice to [[Thar-Vokar/Francesca Vigo\|Francesca Vigo]], and the creator of [[Valedorn/Project Chimera\|Project Chimera]], Alzathorn Ionie aka Alzathorn the Defiler was a twisted mage who focussed on the phenomenon of fear, and how it manifests in organic beings. After having his face burned off by [[Valedorn/General Silas Ranimar, Archmage of War\|General Silas Ranimar, Archmage of War]] and having his wizardly abilities destroyed forever by [[Valedorn/Arnomar Venscribe, Archmage of the Grand Ballad\|Arnomar Venscribe, Archmage of the Grand Ballad]], Alzathorn turned to a new source of magic by signing a warlock pack with an unknown patron. It is highly suspected, though, that the pact was of an Illithid nature, owing to the half of a mindflayer grafted onto the side of his face. 

Ever-focused on creating and maintaing fear, Alzathorn barely escaped  [[Pantheon and Phenomena/The Humbling of the Mages\|The Humbling of the Mages]]
