The King of Valethwyn, and a shrewd ruler at that, Valo IX invited Penn and Maristela to his court in celebration of [[Valedorn/Alzathorn Ionie\|Alzathorn Ionie]]'s demise. Although engaging in conversation, Penn specifically remembers that King was particularly adept at saying a lot while saying very little. What little he did say, however, was indeed honest. 

Although of little surprise for a king who is used to ruling mages, it serves as a stark reminder that he is adept in the art of statecraft, and would be a particularly fearsome political enemy.  

One other sighting of the King occurred during your time in Valethwyn to date was a brief overhearing of a meeting between the King and [[Sister Ivara Cael- Voice of the Emberwardens \|Sister Ivara Cael- Voice of the Emberwardens ]]. Ivara was meeting with the King to discuss the reopening of [[Pantheon and Phenomena/The Arcane Nexus\|The Arcane Nexus]].
