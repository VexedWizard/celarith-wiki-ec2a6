## Letter to [[Valedorn/Alzathorn Ionie\|Alzathorn Ionie]] 
**To Mighty Master Alzathorn the Defiler, Bringer of Nightmuck and Screams Eternal**

HEEHEE! Oh Master! Oh most drippy and dreadful one! Philly writes you with hands still _smokin’!_ The town—what was it called? Creek...Creekwail?—it’s _gone!_ Burned up real good, all crackly and bright! The people ran in circles like fat lil’ firebugs! HA! You shoulda seen their faces melt, Master, all droopy and shiny! I danced on the ashes and my toes still sizzle when I walk!

Now, about [[Project Chimera\|Project Chimera]] —they’re doin’ _so good!_ All _three_ still alive! The tall one grew more teeth last night, the short one keeps gigglin’ to itself, and the middle one’s skin’s turnin’ all see-through—can see its guts sloshin’! I think that’s progress!

Oh! And I got two new test folk! Farmers, I think—they had shiny little trinkets ‘round their necks, shaped like waves  or somethin’. Might be good luck charms? Didn’t help ‘em none! They squealed plenty when I brought ‘em in. Gonna see how they mix with the chimera bits—maybe the shiny things make the soul-stickin’ easier, heehee!

With putrid adoration, 
Philly

P.S Can we have more of the shiny? We're runnin' low...
