The Half-Elf Ivara Cael leads the Emberwardens, the moderate faction of the [[Factions/Holy Order of the Pyre\|Holy Order of the Pyre]]. A skilled statecrafter, she believes magic should be controlled rather than destroyed. She is as pragmatic as she is charismatic, however, recognising that balance within the order is a vital part to its success. As such, she tolerates the more zealous Ashen Hand as a necessary function of the Pyre, at least openly.

Penn and Maristela met Sister Cael at the court of [[Valedorn/King Valo IX\|King Valo IX]], where she encouraged Penn to venture into Thar-Vokar on behalf of the Pyre. Maristela overheard her saying that together, they could 'bring Varnir's Light to Vor'el-Thar', and instantly recognised that for the abject heresy it is. Upon further study, Maristela noted that Sister Cael is driven by a particularly cold and calculating ambition- the kind which would openly kill in order to get what it wants. Maristela thus recognised Sister Cael as quite possibly the most dangerous individual she'd ever come across.
