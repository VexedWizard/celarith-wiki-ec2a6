PERMANENT ALLIES

The parents of Maristela, Elara and Ainar are simple farmers built for a simpler world. They are followers of Allyra, although not to the extent that Maristela is. Indeed, she was somewhat deflated to discover that neither of them had ever done trials in her name. Whilst delighted and proud that their daughter is going off on adventures to realise her true potential, they remain naturally concerned for her wellbeing, and have threatened Penn with death should he let anything happen to her. 

They are currently acclimatising to their new positions as leaders of [[Valedorn/Creekvale\|Creekvale]].
