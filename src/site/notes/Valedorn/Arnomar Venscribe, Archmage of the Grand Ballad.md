This elderly human is a kindly wizard who is responsible for all the great learning in Valethwyn. Although many mistake his mumbling for senility, Arnomar Venscribe is a particularly gifted wizard who, in his heyday, was said to outclass even the most seasoned of archmages. 

While taking a particular shine to Maristela, he divulged that he used the *wish* spell to forbid [[Valedorn/Alzathorn Ionie\|Alzathorn Ionie]] from ever using his wizard abilities again. Arnomar mentioned that this came at the cost of never being able to cast *wish* again. 

Arno is willing to assist the party in their searches for various elements of lore, history and arcane knowledge, and has given the characters the use of the Library Ward in Valethwyn. He has also given Maristela a [[Magic Items/Scribblescrabble\|Scribblescrabble]].
