Garric Holt, a former war engineer, heads the Severant Brotherhood. Unlike the zealots of the Creed, he sees magic as a force to be neutralized and repurposed. He experiments with anti-magic technology and believes the Order should capture mages for study rather than outright execution. Though kind and encouraging to all Templars, more vocal critics within the Order question methods, and worry that left unchecked, he would gladly undertake a similar regimen of experimentation that required the Humbling of the Mages in the first place.
