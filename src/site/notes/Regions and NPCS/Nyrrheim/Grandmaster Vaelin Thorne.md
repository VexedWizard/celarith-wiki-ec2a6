A stern and pragmatic human, Vaelin Thorne oversees the Order in its entirety, as well as being responsible for training the youngest of the orphans. It is unclear to most why Grandmaster Thorne founded the Order in the first place, although rumours abound due to both his arms being replaced by steel prosthetics, works of great Artifice in and of themselves. Although a calculating leader, he is known to have a soft spot for the youngest of the orphans, and is seen as a pastoral figure within the Order.
