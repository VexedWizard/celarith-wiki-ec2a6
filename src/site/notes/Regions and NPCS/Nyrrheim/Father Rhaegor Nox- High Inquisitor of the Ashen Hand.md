Rhaegor Nox preaches that all magic is a blight that must be purged. Templars of the Ashen Hand know this mutilated black dragonborn to be a harsh leader with high expectations, often letting his initiates die to purge weakness. However, once his allegiance and trust is earned, it is rarely lost. He is often an antagonizing force within the Pyre, and is openly of the opinion that the Pyre would be a better Holy Order if all subsects shared his zealotry.
