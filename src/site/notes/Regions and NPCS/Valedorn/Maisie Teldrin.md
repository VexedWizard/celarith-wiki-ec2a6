Owner and proprietor of the Cartographer's Flask in [[Regions and NPCS/Valedorn/Willow's Rest\|Willow's Rest]], Maisie was among the first of the friendly faces that the group met. The jovial half gnome half earth genasi was originally a resident of [[Regions and NPCS/Valedorn/Vermeillon\|Vermeillon]], Maisie lost her wife Tilly in the platinum mine collapse. In her grief, she left the town for Willow's Rest to begin a new life.
