Current Status: ALLY

The youngest son of the Flitt family, Barnabus decided to move away from the family business of being majordomos to Celarith's leaders, and instead forged his own path by becoming the Baron of [[Regions and NPCS/Valedorn/Willow's Rest\|Willow's Rest]]. Unlike his other fmaily memebrs, he has expressed strong opinions on how money should be used when leading a community, namely: it's there for spending. It was Barnabus who suggested that if the group could re-establish the platinum mine in [[Regions and NPCS/Valedorn/Vermeillon\|Vermeillon]], then there would be enough resources for [[Regions and NPCS/Valedorn/Willow's Rest\|Willow's Rest]] to assist in rebuilding [[Regions and NPCS/Valedorn/Creekvale\|Creekvale]] entirely. 

Much to Penn's dismay, he has revealed himself to be a devotee of Erythos (see [[Pantheon and Phenomena/Pantheon\|Pantheon]]).

Appearance:
A short, stocky human with salt and pepper hair, and the characteristic Flitt emerald green eyes. He has notably not seen comabt, as far as you can tell. 

Relations:
[[Regions and NPCS/Valedorn/Phineas Flitt\|Phineas Flitt]]
[[Regions and NPCS/Thar-Vokar/Corellon Flitt\|Corellon Flitt]]
