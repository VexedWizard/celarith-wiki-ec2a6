Current Status: NEUTRAL

Encountered at the court of [[Regions and NPCS/Valedorn/King Valo IX\|King Valo IX]], Sybil Tylira was lurking in the corner of the gathering, seemingly distracted by things that nobody else could see. In conversation with Maristela, she explained that she is part of [[Factions/The Melos Conclave\|The Melos Conclave]], and that she is there to serve as the diviner to the court. Maristela noticed her constantly sipping from a gourd of viscous, green tea coloured liquid. 

Sybil Tylira recognised something in Maristela, noting that she's particularly family-oriented (in her esteem at least), and was willing to work for a collective greater good. She invited Maristela to consider joining the Conclave, noting that she would be free to adventure as she pleased but that the Conclave is a found family, and that may take priority from time to time. Maristela politely declined, but Sybil Tylira simply smiled and left the offer open.
