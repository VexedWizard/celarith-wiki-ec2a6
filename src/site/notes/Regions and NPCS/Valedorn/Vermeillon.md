The site of a mining disaster caused by [[Regions and NPCS/Valedorn/Alzathorn Ionie\|Alzathorn Ionie]], up until recently Vermeillon was a haunted nightmare of an abandoned town. This all changed when Penn and Maristela cleared out the town of [[Bestiary/Meenlocks\|Meenlocks]] and fought Alzathorn in the caves. After using divine rituals to purge the town, Penn and Maristela left the town in physical disrepair, but spiritual stability.
