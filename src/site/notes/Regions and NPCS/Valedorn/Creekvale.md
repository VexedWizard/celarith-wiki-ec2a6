Once a rich and fertile farming community by the ocean in Valedorn, and the birthplace of Maristela, this town was burnt to the ground by [[Regions and NPCS/Valedorn/Philly\|Philly]] on the orders of [[Regions and NPCS/Valedorn/Alzathorn Ionie\|Alzathorn Ionie]]. 

Maristela's parents, [[Regions and NPCS/Valedorn/Elara and Ainar\|Elara and Ainar]], were some of the only survivors of the arson attack, and have since gone on to relocate Creekvale to a plot of land near [[Regions and NPCS/Valedorn/Willow's Rest\|Willow's Rest]]. Last we left them, Maristela and Penn had assisted them in forming a rudimentary community, which can surely only grow with time. [[Regions and NPCS/Valedorn/Elara and Ainar\|Elara and Ainar]] were made the *de facto* leaders of the town by the rest of the community in Maristela's stead.
