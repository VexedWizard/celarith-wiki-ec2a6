The vile experiment of [[Regions and NPCS/Valedorn/Alzathorn Ionie\|Alzathorn Ionie]] and latterly [[Regions and NPCS/Valedorn/Philly\|Philly]] was used top create twisted humanoids by exposing them to the raw fear of magic. Penn and Maristela fought three of these creatures when they attempted to lay waste to [[Regions and NPCS/Valedorn/Willow's Rest\|Willow's Rest]] while [[Regions and NPCS/Valedorn/Baron Barnabus Flitt\|Baron Barnabus Flitt]] ensured the safety of all the residents.
