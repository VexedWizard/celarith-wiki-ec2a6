Current Status: ALLY

A heavily battle-scarred, surly veteran, the high elf Silas Ranimar oversees Valethwyn's  military forces, and personally leads the elite [[Factions/Nightingales\|Nightingales]]. Silas has taken Penn under his wing somewhat, as he is also a devout follower of Varnir (see [[Pantheon and Phenomena/Pantheon\|Pantheon]]). Alongside assisting Penn in discovering other combat techniques, he has also given him a [[Magic Items/Canoncoin\|Canoncoin]].

## For Maristela Only
Further exploration in the halls of the Nightingales led to the discovery that General Ranimar was trained under [[Regions and NPCS/Nyrrheim/Grandmaster Vaelin Thorne\|Grandmaster Vaelin Thorne]] of the [[Factions/Holy Order of the Pyre\|Holy Order of the Pyre]], once a Nightingale himself. Maristela has not broken the news to Penn that the Grandmaster of his order was once an archmage himself.
