*Wondrous Item (common), requires a 1st level binding ritual or spell cast by a friendly wizard*

This otherwise mundane looking journal can be bound to the consciousness of one creature. Once it is bound to them, the Scribblescrabble will recite any legend or fairy tale requested by the creature. The tale is told to them through the memory of the most joyful storyteller they have ever known.

Once bound to a creature, the item will remain loyal to that creature for life. Once the creature dies, the Scribblescrabble crumbles to dust.
