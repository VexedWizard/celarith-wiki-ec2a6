*Wondrous Item (common), requires a 1st level binding ritual or spell cast by a friendly wizard*

This otherwise mundane looking wooden medallion can be bound to the consciousness of one creature. Once it is bound to them, the Canoncoin will recite any canon, theological teaching or legends about the creature's chosen god . requested by the creature. The tale is told to them through the memory of the most meaningful sermon they  have ever heard.

Once bound to a creature, the item will remain loyal to that creature for life. Once the creature dies, the Scribblescrabble crumbles to dust.
