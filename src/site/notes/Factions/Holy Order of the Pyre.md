"*Of embers we are born, through flames we unmake.*"

The  Holy Order of the Pyre is a religious organisation of Varnir,  dedicated to the investigation, hunting and turning of Celarith’s most dangerous arcane practitioners. Operating from the Emberhold Temple in the harsh, icy mountainous region of Nyyrheim, Templars of the Pyre often search the world for the worst of Celarith’s mages. While magic is not zealously condemned by all sects of the Order, let alone in Celarith, the Holy Pyre recognises that (sometimes ruthless) action must be taken against mages to avoid the horrors of the events leading up to the Humbling of the Mages. While some join the Order in their later years, most of the Templars are orphans trained from childhood.

## Doctrine & Divisions

Though all within the Pyre agree that magic is dangerous, divergent approaches to its regulation are present within the Order. As such , the Pyre is split into three factions. 

## The Emberwardens (Moderates)

*Arcane Magic is like wildfire: apocalyptic, but often necessary for growth.* The Emberwardens seek to control magic users, not exterminate them. They often work with governments and churches to regulate magic rather than destroy it outright.

## The Severant Brotherhood (Pragmatists)

 A *dead mage is useless, a converted one is a true weapon.* The Severant Brotherhood do not seek to eradicate mages, but to convert them to the Order’s cause to promote the creation of divine artefacts. They prove their worth to the Order by studying creating Witchbane Steel; a material specifically designed to combat arcane casters. Some defectors from wizard orders and sorcerous bloodlines have forsaken their power and joined them, using their arcane knowledge against their own kind.


## The Ashen Hand (Zealots)

*Arcanum is an affront to Varnir’s Divine might; the Humbling must persist.* The Ashen Hand believe they are chosen by Varnir himself to be divine executioners, empowered by His wrath to sow vengeance. By far the most devout of the ORder, penitence and mortification is prevalent within this sect, although not strictly a requirement. They are also unique in that their practices remain largely shrouded in mystery to the other Pyre factions. 

Despite their differences, all factions remain in fragile unity under Vaelin Thorne’s command. At least, for now.
