The Melos Conclave is a naturalistic hermetic order, which Penn and Maristela first encountered in Valedorn. Although little is known of their ways at this current juncture, it was explained to our heroes that the Conclave uses natural magic to practice something akin to divination.  Their divination capabilities seem to stem from some sort viscous liquid the colour of green tea.

As a result, the Conclave have recently come into popular demand by Celarith's nobility, government officials, and any other powerful agents as a viable replacement for divination mages- often the first ones slaughtered or imprisoned during The Humbling of the Mages.
