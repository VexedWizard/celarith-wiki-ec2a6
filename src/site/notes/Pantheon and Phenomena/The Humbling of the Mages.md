 Up until 10 years ago, Celarith was mostly ruled by a collection of wizard mageocracies and sorcerous dynasties. While this bore considerable fruit, leading to highly advanced civilisation building and arcane technology in many areas, members of Celarith's regions found themselves becoming more and more suspicious of the mages in power. Eventually, evidence of highly unethical experimentation, often on humanoids, as well as abusive and tyrannical ruling practices led to a widespread uprising against these mages, unseating them from power. The uprisings took many different forms from community to community, and varied in terms of violence. 

## Valedorn
The Humbling of the Mages took the form of a mage civil war, with the likes of [[Valedorn/General Silas Ranimar, Archmage of War\|General Silas Ranimar, Archmage of War]] and [[Valedorn/Arnomar Venscribe, Archmage of the Grand Ballad\|Arnomar Venscribe, Archmage of the Grand Ballad]] fighting to bring the more malevolent of their bretheren to justice. All mages were given a fair trial, and where it was not possible to capture all of them, steps were taken to ensure their ability to practice magic was as limited as possible, such as with [[Valedorn/Alzathorn Ionie\|Alzathorn Ionie]].

## Thar-Vokar
Prior to the Humbling, Thar-Vokar and Vor'el-Thar in particular were in the deathgrip of a particularly tyrannical sorcerous dynasty. The Humbling of the Mages, in this instance took the form of a partciularly violent martial uprising against the family. During that revolution it could be argued that the revolutionaries were worse than the mages they were overthrowing; all law and decorum was ignored, and many did not get a fair trial.

The current king of the region was the leader of these revolutionaries.

## Nyrrheim
A place where sometimes only superstition can fend off the desolation, very few communities were ever touched by mageocracies in Nyrrheim. However, it did become a popular destination for mages to have a secluded location for their most awful experimentation. As such, the Humbling of the Mages took the form of swift and judicious execution of any and every mage in the region, without exception. As superstitions grew greater, hermetic orders such as the Order of the Pyre were founded to ensure no mage could ever rise again in the icy peaks of Nyrrheim.
